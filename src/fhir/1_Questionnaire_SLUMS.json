Because this is a standard test, I need to read the questions exactly as they are written and I am not able to answer any questions during the screen. Some of the questions may seem unusual, quite simple or difficult. Just try to answer them as best you can. We will have time for questions at the end. Do you have any questions before we start?”</br></br>Enter the patient’s total score on the next page.</br></br>These questions are to be answered by the <b>patient</b>.<br/>Link to the paper assessment is <a href='https://www.slu.edu/medicine/internal-medicine/geriatric-medicine/aging-successfully/pdfs/slums_form.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>"
